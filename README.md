# README

This is an exercise for our junior web developer position at Family First.

## Notes
- This Rails application already is setup to work with SQLite, Tailwind, Alpine, and ActiveAdmin. You will not need to install any new libraries or gems to complete this exercise.

## Requirements
- Fork this into your personal Github account. After completing the exercise, submit a Pull Request.
- Get it running locally on your computer. You can use the default SQLite database.
- On the landing page do the following:
  - Set the applicant name as set by alpine.js and reflected throughout the page
  - Change the photo to your photo
  - Set your bio
  - Change the bullets to a list of your top strengths and skills
  - Change out the logos and names at the bottom and have them link to Ruby on Rails, ActiveAdmin, Tailwind, Alpine
- Create a model with CRUD controller and views for a Contact model with the following fields (you can choose to use scaffolding):
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
- Style the scaffolding using Tailwind CSS
- Create an ActiveAdmin resource for the Contact model and ensure it works to create, edit, and delete contacts
- Find a way to integrate at least one usage of Alpine into your scaffolding somewhere. Examples: search field for the index, filters drop down, collapsible menus
